This project takes a closer look at the American sitcom TV series, The Office, that depicts the everyday lives of office employees at the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. Our dataset consists of character page content from the wiki fandom page [Dunderpedia](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) as well as the characters' dialogue from the entire show - 9 seasons in total. 

The Office is a very entertaining and totally binge-worhty series, which despite the at times dark humour will get you laughing repeadedly for every episode. Being fans of the show, our main motivation for chosing this dataset was to get a deeper insight into the characters, their relations and how they evolve throughout the series.
