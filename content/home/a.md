This project takes a closer look at the American sitcom TV series, The Office, that depicts the everyday lives of office employees at the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. Our dataset consists of character page content from the wiki fandom page [Dunderpedia](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) as well as the characters' dialogue from the entire show - 9 seasons in total. 

The Office is a very entertaining and totally binge-worhty series, which despite the at times dark humour will get you laughing repeadedly for every episode. Being fans of the show, our main motivation for chosing this dataset was to get a deeper insight into the characters, their relations and how they evolve throughout the series.

As **compared to the Zelda BotW network**, the wiki fandom for the The Office contains fewer and less detailed character descriptions, hence we expect our analysis will depend on the dialogues dataset to a greater extend. This allows us to explore the text analysis tools we have learned in the course as well as come up with new analyses, where we combine the methods we've learned in new ways. Being a mockumentary, the characters are caricatures of regular office workers, and we hope to be able to describe the characters from their language and compare with how we already know them from watching the show.

For the readers who are unfamiliar with the TV series, we have included a brief description of the main characeters in the show (WARNING: spoilers!):<br>
**Michael**: The regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch from Season 1-7 and main character of the series. He is a well-intentioned man with quite a special type of humor, while seemingly innocent to himself, he often offends and annoys his employees. In the end of the 7th season, he proposes to HR representative Holly Flax and moves to Colorado leaving the manager position to Andy.<br>
**Dwight**: a salesman and the assistant to the regional manager, a fictional title created by Michael. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial arts and the justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He is also known for his romantic relationship with Angela Martin, head of the accounting department.<br>
**Jim**: also works as a salesman at the office. He is intelligent and mild-mannered, but also defined by his rivalrous pranking on fellow salesman Dwight Schrute. For several seasons he and the receptionist Pam are the "will-they-won't-they" couple. They begin dating in the fourth season, marries in the sixth, and has children with in the sixth and eighth.<br>
**Pam**:  is initially the receptionist at Dunder Mifflin, before becoming a saleswoman and eventually office administrator. Her character is shy, friendly, assertive, and artistically inclined.
